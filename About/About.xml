  <description>An attempt to stop visitors wandering into dangerous or off limits areas.
This mod will make guests and traders listen to forbidden doors as long as the faction relations are above -20.
Works with vanilla traders as well as guests added by the Hospitality mod - No more will guests open the door for raids or take the short cut through insect filled rooms!

Please note that forbidding all paths a trader has will cause them to panic and make their own way, you have been warned!</description>
